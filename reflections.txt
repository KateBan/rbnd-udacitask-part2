# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spend about 10 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Completing the whole project was a challenge. There were times
 I wanted to cry. Not kidding, but the
feeling you get after you make something to work is wonderful!

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
My first feature allows multiple items to be deleated at once.
I think it is very cool to be able to delete as much 
items as you want at once. It is efficient.
My second featureallows you to change the priority
level of an item. Because as we know priorities change, and 
we should have option to switch them.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I've learned so much since I started this nano degree.
But there is alwys room for more. I want to learn how to build 
more complex apps.
